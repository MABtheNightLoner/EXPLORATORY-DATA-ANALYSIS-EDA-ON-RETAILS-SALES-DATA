### Recommedation 
Based on the statistical summary provided, here are some recommendations:
 
1. Customer Age Targeting: 
   - The mean age of customers is 41.39 years, with a standard deviation of 13.681. The mode is 43 years, indicating a relatively mature customer base. Marketing strategies should be tailored to appeal to this age group, possibly focusing on products and services that cater to middle-aged consumers.  
2. Product Quantity Optimization:
   - The mean quantity purchased is 2.51 units, with a median of 3 and a mode of 4. This suggests that most customers buy in small quantities. Consider offering bulk purchase discounts or promotions to encourage higher volume purchases per transaction, which could increase overall sales. 
3. Price Sensitivity: 
   - The mean price per unit is relatively high at 179.89, with a large standard deviation of 189.681. This indicates significant variability in product pricing. The median and mode price is 50, suggesting that lower-priced items are more commonly purchased. To cater to a broader audience, consider expanding the range of products at lower price points or running promotions on high-end items to make them more accessible.
4. Revenue Enhancement:
   - The mean total amount spent per transaction is 456.00, but the median is only 135.00, indicating that most transactions are lower in value. To boost overall revenue, you could implement upselling and cross-selling strategies, encouraging customers to add complementary products to their purchases.
 
5. Pricing Strategy Adjustment: 
   - Given the significant variability in the price per unit and total amount, consider conducting a deeper analysis to understand the factors driving high and low spending. Adjusting pricing strategies, such as dynamic pricing or personalized discounts, could help in maximizing profit margins while maintaining customer satisfaction.
